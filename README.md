# Data Science & Machine Learning Internship Portfolio

## üåü Welcome to This Portfolio!

Hello and welcome to this GitHub repository! This space is dedicated to showcasing hands-on projects in the exciting fields of Data Science and Machine Learning. As a Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) student, this repository contains project work undertaken as part of a Data Science internship with Unified Mentor. I am deeply passionate about leveraging Python for advanced applications in Data Science (DS), Machine Learning (ML), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Deep Learning (DL), and I am thrilled to be exploring these cutting-edge technologies.



## üìÅ Projects Overview

This repository is structured to provide clear access to individual projects, each meticulously documented to explain objectives, methodologies, and key insights. Here's a glimpse into the work you'll find:

### 1. üìä Netflix Data: Cleaning, Analysis, and Visualization

- **Difficulty Level:** Intermediate  
- **Description:** This project delves into a comprehensive Netflix content dataset, employing robust data cleaning techniques to ensure data quality. It then proceeds with an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover fascinating trends in content distribution, popular genres, and the evolution of content additions over time. The project culminates in insightful visualizations that provide a clear narrative of Netflix's content landscape and identifies top contributing directors and countries. 
- **Tools Used:** Python, ML, SQL, Excel  
- **Skills Demonstrated:** Data Cleaning, EDA, Data Visualization, Python, SQL, Excel
