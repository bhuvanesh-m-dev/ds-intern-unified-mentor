# Social Media Platform Usage Pie Chart


This project visualizes the usage distribution of various social media platforms using a pie chart. The data is sourced from a CSV file (`data.csv`) containing survey responses about the most used social media platforms. The visualization is generated by the `pie_chart.py` script, which reads the data, calculates the percentage usage for each platform, and displays a clean, color-differentiated pie chart with a legend.
