# 📊 Boxplot with IQR – Data Distribution Visualization

This project visualizes the distribution of a simple dataset using a **boxplot** built with `matplotlib` and `numpy`.

## 🔢 Statistics Computed

* **Minimum**
* **Q1 (25th percentile)**
* **Median (Q2)**
* **Q3 (75th percentile)**
* **Maximum**
* **IQR (Q3 - Q1)**

These are annotated on the boxplot for clarity.

## 📈 Output

The boxplot helps visualize:

* Central tendency (median)
* Spread (IQR)
* Outliers (beyond 1.5×IQR)

## 📌 Why IQR?

* **Robust** against outliers
* **Used for detecting anomalies**
* **Represents middle 50%** of data
