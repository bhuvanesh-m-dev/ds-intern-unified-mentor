# 📍 Folium Map 

This is a simple project created during my Data Science internship.  
Here, I learned how to use the `folium` library in Python to generate interactive maps.

### 🧠 Extra Tips

- ✅ **Use a thumbnail preview image** of the map (if iframe doesn’t render on GitHub):
  
  Take a screenshot of the map and upload it to your GitHub repo, then:

```markdown

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to import and use the `folium` library.
- Creating a basic map centered at a specific location (Chennai).
- Adding a marker with a popup and tooltip.
- Saving the map as an HTML file which can be opened in a browser.

## 💡 Final Thoughts

The HTML file generated by this code is fully reusable. You can directly use it in any web development project — for showcasing maps, location-based data, or visual insights.  
This was a simple yet powerful introduction to interactive mapping using Python.

## 🧾 Code Used

```python
import folium

m = folium.Map(location=[13.0827, 80.2707], zoom_start=12)

folium.Marker(
    location=[13.0827, 80.2707],
    popup="Hello from Chennai!",
    tooltip="Click me"
).add_to(m)

m.save("mymap.html")
print("Map saved as mymap.html")
